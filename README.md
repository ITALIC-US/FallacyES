## Description

This repository contains both the FallacyES corpus, and a Jupyter notebook with the experiments shown in the paper.

### Corpus
The corpus is composed of two sections:

- Prototypical fallacies: these are examples of fallacies obtained from educational materials. The examples have been translated and corrected from the "Logical Fallacy Dataset" (https://github.com/tmakesense/logical-fallacy/tree/main/dataset-fixed), which in turn is a corrected version of "LOGIC" (https://github.com/causalNLP/logical-fallacy). In addition, examples of non-fallacies have been added.

- Spontaneous fallacies: these are examples of fallacies obtained from real user comments on a news aggregator website (reference). Examples of non-fallacies have also been located from the same source.

Both sections are available in ``dataset`` folder, including a description of each column in ``dataset/FallacyES.md`` file
